This project will analyse correlation between graffiti and street lighting in Vancouver, CA. Cleaning costs for graffiti can be a large expense in a big city and reducing it is in the interest of the city council of Vancouver as well as private companies.

Allocating a budget that is efficient and effective is every government's purpose. The project's aim is to help in predicting graffiti based on lighting, making it easier to focus cleaning efforts. This project will help the city council of Vancouver to improve their citizenâ€™s livelihoods by having a cleaner environment too. Moreover, The data will also be used to prevent further graffiti by suggesting additional street lighting where needed. It will help the city council of Vancouver to act earlier and more precisely if there is a potential for other graffiti to appear in some area. This project will recommend places to put new street lights in order to discourage future graffiti.

The results will will contain our visualisations and the conclusions inferred from them.

While the studied location of this project is Vancouver, this work will be publicly available. Hence, other officials from all over the globe may also view it. Therefore, it may prompt a new way of dealing with graffiti before it occurs.

Data for graffiti, street light poles, buildings and local area geolocation was downloaded on Monday 13th

Steps:

1. Run python data\_cleaning/combine\_lighting\_and\_graffiti.py
1. Run python data\_cleaning/calculate\_geolocal\_area\_meters\_squared.py (getting the area in m2 from the local boundary)
1. Run python data\_cleaning/calculate\_buildinds\_area\_meters\_squared.py (getting the area in m2 from the buildings)
