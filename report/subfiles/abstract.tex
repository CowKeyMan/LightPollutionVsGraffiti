Graffiti is a global problem which is costing governments billions of dollars each year for cleanup and repair costs. Prevalence of graffiti can also lead to other negative effects such as discouraging tourism and cause damage on affected surfaces. In this project we conduct to the best of our knowledge the first ever study about finding methods to predict and prevent graffiti using the features of a city. Our methods are preliminary, but show promising results. While future work may uncover better features in predicting this act of vandalism, our methods are a good starting point and can already be used to show hypothetical relationships between the chosen city features and the generation of graffiti.
