Graffiti is a global problem which is costing governments billions of dollars each year for cleanup and repair costs. It can also lead to other negative effects such as discouraging tourism and damaging the surface it is defacing. In this project we conduct what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first ever study about methods to predict and prevent graffiti using the features of a city. Our results show that our methods are promising. While future work may uncover better features in predicting this act of vandalism, our methods are a good starting point and can already be used to show hypothetical relationships between the chosen city features and the generation of graffiti.
