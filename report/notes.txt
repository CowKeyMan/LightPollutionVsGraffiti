Process:
  When visualising map the first time, we found that most graffiti reside on buildings
  Some areas had seemingly total darkness but no graffiti. These turned out to be parks or other areas without objects, which makes it impossible for graffiti to occur
  Graffiti seems to be mostly concentrated in downtown and major streets (highly populated areas - hence we decided to also add population data to our project)


Early visualisation shows that our hypothesis does hold true for some cases
distance was taken with longitude and latitude, so we used geodesic (check that this is what it is called)

we compared geodesic to euclidean distance and 165463 rows out of 165466 matched, but euclidean distance runs under a minute so we keps using it

all property adresses have different coordinates, except for 2 of them
