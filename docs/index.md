## Can light pollution deter graffiti?

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/CowKeyMan/LightPollutionVsGraffiti/edit/master/docs/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

### What do we do?

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/CowKeyMan/LightPollutionVsGraffiti/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### What's our goal?

The project's aim is to help in predicting graffiti based on lighting, making it easier to focus cleaning efforts. This project will help the city council of Vancouver to improve their citizenâ€™s livelihoods by having a cleaner environment too. Moreover, The data will also be used to prevent further graffiti by suggesting additional street lighting where needed. It will help the city council of Vancouver to act earlier and more precisely if there is a potential for other graffiti to appear in some area. This project will recommend places to put new street lights in order to discourage future graffiti.

### Who can use this?

While the studied location of this project is Vancouver, this work will be publicly available. Hence, other officials from all over the globe may also view it. Therefore, it may prompt a new way of dealing with graffiti before it occurs.
