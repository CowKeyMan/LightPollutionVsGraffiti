## Predicting Graffiti using City Layouts

### What do we do?

This project will analyse correlation between graffiti and street lighting in Vancouver, CA. Cleaning costs for graffiti can be a large expense in a big city and reducing it is in the interest of the city council of Vancouver as well as private companies. Therefore, allocating a budget that is efficient and effective is every government's purpose

### Why does the government need this?

In July 2021, Vancouver city spend half a million dollars on graffiti removal [Link](https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/vancouver-graffiti-removal-half-a-million). It is said that there is an increasing phone call to 311 about 87%. One of the reason is because there's a spike in nuissance graffiti during Covid-19 pandemic [Link](https://globalnews.ca/news/8240692/vancouver-spike-nuisance-graffiti-calls-311-covid-19-pandemic/). The presence of graffiti in an area over a long period of time encourages the appearance of other graffiti. Besides that, graffiti leads to the racist attack too [Link](https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/local-news/mural-in-vancouvers-chinatown-targeted-in-racist-attack-3932501).

### What is our goal?

The project's aim is to help in predicting graffiti based on lighting, making it easier to focus cleaning efforts. This project will help the city council of Vancouver to improve their citizenâ€™s livelihoods by having a cleaner environment too. Moreover, The data will also be used to prevent further graffiti by suggesting additional street lighting where needed. It will help the city council of Vancouver to act earlier and more precisely if there is a potential for other graffiti to appear in some area. This project will recommend places to put new street lights in order to discourage future graffiti.

### Where do the data come from?
