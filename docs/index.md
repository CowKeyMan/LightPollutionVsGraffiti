# Predicting Graffiti using City Layouts

## The Task

This project will analyse what properties of a city correlates with graffiti generation in Vancouver, CA. Cleaning costs for graffiti can be a large expense in a big city and reducing it is in the interest of the city council of Vancouver as well as private companies. Therefore, we will be aiding governments to allocate efficient and effective budgets with regards to managing graffiti around their cities.

## Necessity

In July 2021, Vancouver city spend [half a million dollars on graffiti removal](https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/vancouver-graffiti-removal-half-a-million). During the Covid-19 pandemic, there was a [spike of nuissance graffiti](https://globalnews.ca/news/8240692/vancouver-spike-nuisance-graffiti-calls-311-covid-19-pandemic/), resulting in an increase of 87% in calls to 311. The presence of graffiti in an area over a long period of time encourages the appearance of other graffiti. Moreover, graffiti has sometimes lead to [racist attacks](https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/local-news/mural-in-vancouvers-chinatown-targeted-in-racist-attack-3932501) as well. Lastly, this problem goes beyond just Vancouver. It is a global problem. On the other side of the globe, [Australlia spends 1.5 Billion Dollars anually on graffiti removal](https://www.crimestopperswa.com.au/for-schools/graffiti-action-challenge/useful-information/whats-the-cost-of-graffiti/).


## The Goal

The aim of this project is to help predict graffiti based on features of the city, making it easier to focus cleaning efforts. We will be focus on individual buildings, and using the provided data on how much graffiti each building has, we will be able to identify features which led to the building being clean or vandalized. This project will help the city council of Vancouver to improve livelihoods of their citizens by having a cleaner home. Moreover, the data will be used to prevent further graffiti by suggesting city layout changes or increased enforcement in select areas where this is needed. It will help the city council of Vancouver to act earlier and more precisely if there is a potential for other graffiti to appear in some areas. The project will also be able to identify which common features of cities prevent or encourage graffiti to be put there in the first place.

## Data Sources

The [Open Data Portal](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/) of the City of Vancouver will be used in this project.

## Target Audience

While the studied location of this project is Vancouver, this work will be publicly available. Hence, other officials from all over the globe may also view it. Therefore, it may prompt a new way of dealing with graffiti before it occurs. Furthermore, city planners may use it to design cities which are graffiti proof by design. Lastly, we will also be leaving some small technical details in the report, to inspire other researchers to explore this area further. For the methodology, other researchers can check out the latex report on [github](https://github.com/CowKeyMan/PredictingGraffitiUsingCityLayouts).
