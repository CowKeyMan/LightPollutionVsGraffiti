Of the total 72965 studided buildings, 5784 (8.61%) of them are vandalized, while the remaining 67181 are free of graffiti. Each building can contain more than one act of vandalism. The following is a heatmap of the existing graffiti on each building in Vancouver, where darker colours indicate more graffiti on a particular building:

If we study the buildings with graffiti on them, we see that there is an exponential drop off in the distribution of graffiti. This means that most vandalized buildings have only one graffiti on them.

Most of the graffiti is located at the north east area of Vancouver, namely in Downtown, Strathcona, Grandview-Woodland and Mount Pleasant. While we do not focus on the local area itself, our results do consider certain characteristics of each area, such as the population and the physical area.

We will also be taking street data into account. We can see that most graffiti are in ???, ??? and ??? streets. Similarly to local areas, we do not focus on individual streets, but we do consider street details, specifically the type of street. From the next visualisation we can see that, while there are many more residential roads, if a building lies in an arterial street, then it has a much higher chance of being vandalized.

Our models also take other building properties into account, such as the height, area and the type of roof that a building has. From the below visualisation, we can see that although there are many more pitched roof types, there is a higher chance for a building with a flat roof to be vandalized than any other type of building.
