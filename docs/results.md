# Results

In this chapter, we discuss the results obtained by our machine learning models. For our purposes, we considered two tasks to solve. The first is a regression problem, where we try to predict the actual number of graffiti that will be on each building. The second problem is classification, where we predict whether a building will be vandalized with graffiti or not.

## Regression

In this section, we will be considering the problem of regression. We trained several models to see which types fit this problem better. This also allows us to see the relationships between the different features better. The two that stood out were the Linear Regression models and the Neural Network model.

While the Linear Regression gave an R^2 score of 0.60 on the test set, the Neural Network gave a score of 0.62. However, these include the buildings with 0 graffiti. If we remove these and only consider the ones with graffiti, the R^2 of Linear Regression is 0.38, while that of the Neural Network is 0.41. This means that if we were to use these models on another city, we would choose the Neural Network. Fortunately for us, Linear Regression is not so far behind in terms of score, hence we can use to to explain and highlight the important features which contribute to a building being more or less vandalized.

We use the Linear Regression to highlight explain the most contributing features because it is much easier to explain than the Neural Network. These are shown in the following two tables, alongside their importance. The first table shows features which our model have found to deter graffiti. The less the coefficient, the more they deter. The second table shows which features were found to increase the chances of a building to be vandalized. The higher the coefficient, the higher the importance of the feature.

|Feature|coefficient|
|pop\_density|-7.68047|
|street\_type\_residential|-0.04914|
|two\_houses\_away\_buildings\_average\_sub\_buildings|-0.04567|
|one\_house\_away\_buildings\_average\_height|-0.03249|
|one\_house\_away\_buildings\_count|-0.02273|

This tables tells us that the higher the population in an area, the less chance of graffiti. Furthermore, buildings on a residential street are less likely to be vandalized. Furthermore, areas which are more dense also have an advantage over sparser areas. Lastly, tall buildings in the vicinity of a building were found to also contribute to deterring graffiti.

|Feature|coefficient|
|one\_house\_away\_graffiti\_average|0.46045|
|four\_houses\_away\_graffiti\_average|0.31345|
|two\_houses\_away\_graffiti\_average|0.27223|
|street\_type\_arterial|0.16828|
|roof\_type\_Flat|0.09962|

From this table we learn that more graffiti in the vicinity of a building will increase the chances of that building having graffiti. Buildings on arterial streets and those with flat roof types will also have a higher chance of being vandalized.

As a result of these tables, we learn that, when planning cities, we should have more dense areas, and less buildings with very few people next to them. Our hypothesis for this is that if there are more people in an area, there are consequently more eyes protecting it from vandalism. We also learn that graffiti spreads similar to a virus. Hence, in cleanup operations, buildings at the edge of the 'infected' area should be dealt with first, because buildings at the heart of the area have a higher chance of having graffiti put on them again. Furthermore, we should avoid building on arterial roads. Lastly, since buildings with a flat roof type attract more graffiti, we should invest in higher quality and more elaborate buildings, rather than plain ones. In the long run, this will be more cost effective since there will not be any need to cleanup.

The following map shows the resulting Vancouver graffiti heatmap if nothing is done. This was generated by fitting a linear regression model on the entire dataset and then putting that same dataset through the same model.

## Classification

Next, we consider the problem of classification, where buildings either have graffiti or they do not. This means that we are not concerned with the amount of graffiti the building contains, just if it is clean or if it has been vandalized.
